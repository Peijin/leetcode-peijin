/**
 Let f(x) be the number of zeroes at the end of x!. (Recall that x! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * x, and by convention, 0! = 1.)

 For example, f(3) = 0 because 3! = 6 has no zeroes at the end, while f(11) = 2 because 11! = 39916800 has 2 zeroes at the end. Given K, find how many non-negative integers x have the property that f(x) = K.
