/*  There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

    Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

    Example 1:
    nums1 = [1, 3]
    nums2 = [2]
    The median is 2.0

    Example 2:
    nums1 = [1, 2]
    nums2 = [3, 4]
    The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
